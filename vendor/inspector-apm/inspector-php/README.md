# Inspector

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inspector-apm/inspector-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inspector-apm/inspector-php)
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/log-engine/logengine-php/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/inspector-apm/inspector-php)

Inspector is a composer package to add Real-Time performance and error alerting in your Laravel applications.

Install the latest version by:

```shell
composer require inspector-apm/inspector-php
```

## Use

To start sending data to Inspector you need an API key to create a configuration instance. You can obtain `INSPECTOR_API_KEY` creating a new project in your [Inspector](https://www.inspector.dev) dashboard.

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Inspector\Inspector;
use Inspector\Configuration;

$configuration = new Configuration('YOUR_API_KEY');
$inspector = new Inspector($configuration);
```

All start with a `transaction`. Transaction represent an execution cycle and it can contains one or hundred of segments:

```php
// Start execution cycle with a transaction
$inspector->startTransaction($_SERVER['PATH_INFO']);

// Trace performance of code blocks
$segment = $inspector->startSegment('my-process');
try {

    throw new UnauthorizedException("You don't have permission to access.");

} catch(UnauthorizedException $exception) {
    $inspector->reportException($exception);
} finally {
    $segment->end();
}
```

Inspector will collect many useful information to produce performance chart in your dashboard.
